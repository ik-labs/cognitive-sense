CognitiveSense is an AI-powered Chrome extension that protects users from manipulation tactics on shopping and social media platforms.

Key Features:
â€¢ 12 Detectors: 6 for shopping manipulation (urgency, anchoring, social proof, FOMO, bundling, dark patterns) + 6 for social media manipulation (misinformation, emotional manipulation, echo chambers, fake accounts, toxicity, political manipulation)
â€¢ 4 Chrome AI APIs: Prompt API (detection), Writer API (warnings), Translator API (8 languages), Summarizer API (future)
